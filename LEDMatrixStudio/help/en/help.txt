  Left mouse button draws on the matrix in the ON colour
  Right mosue button draws on the matrix in the OFF colour.
 
  When using drawing modes (rectange, circle etc.), the button that is first clicked
  determines the final draw colour.
 
  In bicolour or RGB mode, the colour selection for each button is shown
  on the left of the draw tools toolbar. 
  
  In gradient mode (RGB and bicolour only) the middle mouse button is used
  to draw with the gradient.

Top Toolbar (left to right)

  Select matrix size, from 1x1 to 32x32.

  Create
  
    Set up a matrix of the selected dimensions.

  Pixel size (Tiny, Small, Medium, Large, Massive, Ultra)

    Choose how big each "pixel" should be within the software.

  Pixel shape (Square or Circluar)

    The shape of each "pixel" on screen.

  Preset

    Press the right mouse button on this button for options.

    Load an already saved preset.
    Save the current preset.

    Presets contain the matrix size and row data orientations.

  Undo

    Undo the last major operation.

  Using x bytes.

    Displays the amount of memory required to store the current matrix/animation.


******************************************************************************************

********************************************************************************************

Middle toolbar (left to right)

  Clear

    Clears the current frame.
	
	Clear all frames from the Project Menu->Clear all frames.

  Flip

    Flips the current matrix horizontally.

    A separate menu item exists for flipping every frame in the current animation.

  Mirror

    Flips the matrix vertically.

    A separate menu item exists for mirroring every frame in the current animation.

  Invert
  
    Inverts the pixels so "on" becomes "off" and "off" becomes "on".

    A separate menu item exists for inverting every frame in the current animation.

  Left / Right / Up / Down
  
    Scrolls the matrix one pixel in the specified direction.

  Rotate L / Rotate R

    Rotates the matrix 90' in the selection direction.

  Rotate

   Creates a selected number of frames where each frame is rotated a set number of degrees
   further than the preceeding frame, starting from the current frame.

   Works much better with higher sized displays, but will still require some user tweaking.

  5' to 90'

   Select the amount of degrees to rotate for each frame.

  1 to 72

   Select the number of frames to create.
