 Hello!
 
 Thanks for downloading the latest version of my LED Matrix Studio.

 A few years ago I started playing with Picaxe and Arduino 
 microcontrollers and one of the first things I bought was an 8x8
 LED matrix. In the passing couple of years I've bought lots and lots
 of LED boards! I love LEDs, I think it's an addiction!

 After working out the bit-patterns on a piece of paper a couple of
 times I did what any programmer would do - I wrote a simple 
 program to work out the bit-patterns for me. That simple program
 morphed in to three separate programs, each designed for slightly 
 different things. 

 On the 10th of June 2012 I decided to start from scratch and
 build an all-purpose application with every feature I (and others)
 could ever want.
 
 I've designed it to be as easy to use as possible. Click New and select
 the size and type of matrix you need.

 A simple column and row data display are available at the bottom
 of the display, but select Export from the Project menu to take
 advantage of the software's export options. 
 
 Incidentally, if you think there is an option missing then please email
 me and I'll make sure it gets added to the next release.
 
 There is a special Sure Electronics 24x16 mode that outputs the column
 data in the order that the device requires. This is one of my favourite
 matrix devices, hence why I have this mode!
 
 Please email me if you have any special requests for other devices. 

 Features:
 
 - Supports up to 128x128 matrix
 - Supports single colour, bi-colour and RGB matrices
 - Seven sizes of "pixel" allows for use on almost any resolution PC
   Plus auto-size!
 - Square or round "pixels"
 - Three brush sizes (1 pixel, 2x2 and 3x3 pixels)
 - Export data in all possible combinations!
 - Export as code or binary
 - Select either binary, decimal or hex output (with $ or 0x prefix)
 - Select either normal, curly or square brackets
 - Many different draw modes
     simple click to toggle on/off (left mouse button)
     Freehand draw mode (right mouse button)
     Filled rectangles
     Empty rectangles
	 Empty circle
     Line from A->B
	 Multi-draw (all frames simultaneously)
     Text (using customisable fonts, two included 5x7 and 3x5)
	 Random
	 Gradient (draw using the middle button)
 - Flip, mirror, invert, rotate, scroll a matrix
 - Animation support, unlimited number of frames
 - Font designer mode (single colour or RGB)
 - Unlimited per-frame undo/redo
 - Save/Load native format
 - Unlimited "presets", predefined sizes and formats
 - Export animation or single frame
 - 10 separate user buffers/scratchpads
 - Auto-save option
 - Import from bitmap image (one or more frames)
 - Export to bitmap 
 - Preview mode, view the image at x1, x2, x3, x4, x5 and x6 pixel size.
 - Open source, download from the address at the top of this doc

 If you find a bug or have a feature request then *please* email me.
 
 Look in the /help/ folder for more information.
 
 Many thanks,

 Paul A Freshney (paul@freshney.org)

 Help wanted!

 Have you created a fantastic animation, font, graphic or a preset
 for an LED matrix device?

 Please consider sending it to me so that I may include it with
